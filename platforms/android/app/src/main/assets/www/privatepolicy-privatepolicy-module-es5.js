We only send emails to people who have authorized us to\n            contact them, either directly, or through a third party. We do not send unsolicited commercial emails,\n            because we hate spam as much as you do.

Email addresses\n            submitted only through the order processing page will be used for the sole purpose of sending you\n            information and updates pertaining to your order. If, however, you have provided the same email to us\n            through another method, we may use it for any of the purposes stated in this Policy. Note: If at any time\n            you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, we include detailed unsubscribe instructions at\n            the bottom of each email.</p>\n        <p><strong>How Long Do We Keep Your Information?</strong></p>\n        <p>We keep your information only so long as we need it to provide SNTC Rice Sourcing to you and fulfill the\n            purposes described in this policy. This is also the case for anyone that we share your information with and\n            who carries out services on our behalf. When we no longer need to use your information and there is no need\n            for us to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, we’ll either remove it from our\n            systems or depersonalize it so that we can’t identify you.</p>\n        <p><strong>How Do We Protect Your Information?</strong></p>\n        <p>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you\n            place an order or enter, submit, or access your personal information. We offer the use of a secure server.\n            All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then\n            encrypted into our Payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by those authorized with special\n            access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. After a transaction,\n            your private information (credit cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.) is never kept on file. We\n            cannot, however, ensure or warrant the absolute security of any information you transmit to SNTC Rice\n            Sourcing or guarantee that your information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or\n            destroyed by a breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.</p>\n        <p><strong>Could my information be transferred to other countries?</strong></p>\n        <p>SNTC Rice Sourcing is incorporated in India. Information collected via our website, through direct\n            interactions with you, or from use of our help services may be transferred from time to time to our offices\n            or personnel, or to third parties, located throughout the world, and may be viewed and hosted anywhere in\n            the world, including countries that may not have laws of general applicability regulating the use and\n            transfer of such data. To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, by using any of the above, you\n            voluntarily consent to the trans-border transfer and hosting of such information.</p>\n        <p><strong>Is the information collected through the SNTC Rice Sourcing Service secure?</strong></p>\n        <p>We take precautions to protect the security of your information. We have physical, electronic, and managerial\n            procedures to help safeguard, prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use your\n            information. However, neither people nor security systems are foolproof, including encryption systems. In\n            addition, people can commit intentional crimes, make mistakes or fail to follow policies. Therefore, while\n            we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.\n            If applicable law imposes any non-disclaimable duty to protect your personal information, you agree that\n            intentional misconduct will be the standards used to measure our compliance with that duty.</p>\n        <p><strong>Can I update or correct my information?</strong></p>\n        <p>The rights you have to request updates or corrections to the information SNTC Rice Sourcing collects depend\n            on your relationship with SNTC Rice Sourcing.

To protect your privacy and security, we may take reasonable steps (such as\n            requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you profile access or making\n            corrections. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information\n            at all times.</p>\n        <p>You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of the\n            information you have provided to us from our system. The need to back up our systems to protect information\n            from inadvertent loss means that a copy of your information may exist in a non-erasable form that will be\n            difficult or impossible for us to locate. Promptly after receiving your request, all personal information\n            stored in databases we actively use, and other readily searchable media will be updated, corrected, changed\n            or deleted, as appropriate, as soon as and to the extent reasonably and technically practicable.</p>\n        <p>If you are an end user and wish to update, delete, or receive any information we have about you, you may do\n            so by contacting the organization of which you are a customer.</p>\n        <p><strong>Personnel</strong></p>\n        <p>If you are a SNTC Rice Sourcing worker or applicant, we collect information you voluntarily provide to us.

Such updates, corrections, changes and deletions will have no effect on\n            other information that we maintain, or information that we have provided to third parties in accordance with\n            this Privacy Policy prior to such update, correction, change or deletion.</p>\n        <p><strong>Sale of Business</strong></p>\n        <p>We reserve the right to transfer information to a third party in the event of a sale, merger or other\n            transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of SNTC Rice Sourcing or any of its Corporate Affiliates\n            (as defined herein), or that portion of SNTC Rice Sourcing or any of its Corporate Affiliates to which the\n            Service relates, or in the event that we discontinue our business or file a petition or have filed against\n            us a petition in bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding, provided that the third party agrees to\n            adhere to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>\n        <p><strong>Affiliates</strong></p>\n        <p>We may disclose information (including personal information) about you to our Corporate Affiliates.

A Session is a small piece of data stored on your computer or mobile device by your web\n            browser.</p>\n        <p><strong>Information about General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</strong></p>\n        <p>We may be collecting and using information from you if you are from the European Economic Area (EEA), and in\n            this section of our Privacy Policy we are going to explain exactly how and why is this data collected, and\n            how we maintain this data under protection from being replicated or used in the wrong way.</p>\n        <p><strong>What is GDPR?</strong></p>\n        <p>GDPR is an EU-wide privacy and data protection law that regulates how EU residents’ data is protected by\n            companies and enhances the control&nbsp;the EU residents have, over their personal data.</p>\n        <p>The GDPR is relevant to any globally operating company and not just the EU-based businesses and EU residents.\n            Our customers’ data is important irrespective of where they are located, which is why we have implemented\n            GDPR controls as our baseline standard for all our operations worldwide.</p>\n        <p><strong>What is personal data?</strong></p>\n        <p>Any data that relates to an identifiable or identified individual. GDPR covers a broad spectrum of\n            information that could be used on its own, or in combination with other pieces of information, to identify a\n            person. Personal data extends beyond a person’s name or email address. Some examples include financial\n            information, political opinions, genetic data, biometric data, IP addresses, physical address, sexual\n            orientation, and ethnicity.</p>\n        <p><strong>The Data Protection Principles include requirements such as:</strong></p>\n        <p>-Personal data collected must be processed in a fair, legal, and transparent way and should only be used in a\n            way that a person would reasonably expect.<br>\n            -Personal data should only be collected to fulfil a specific purpose and it should only be used for that\n            purpose. Organizations must specify why they need the personal data when they collect it.<br>\n            -Personal data should be held no longer than necessary to fulfil its purpose.<br>\n            -People covered by the GDPR have the right to access their own personal data. They can also request a copy\n            of their data, and that their data be updated, deleted, restricted, or moved to another organization.</p>\n        <p><strong>Why is GDPR important?</strong></p>\n        <p>GDPR adds some new requirements regarding how companies should protect individuals’ personal data that they\n            collect and process. It also raises the stakes for compliance by increasing enforcement and imposing greater\n            fines for breach. Beyond these facts it’s simply the right thing to do. At SNTC Rice Sourcing we strongly\n            believe that your data privacy is very important and we already have solid security and privacy practices in\n            place that go beyond the requirements of this new regulation.</p>\n        <p><strong>Individual Data Subject’s Rights – Data Access, Portability and Deletion</strong></p>\n        <p>We are committed to helping our customers meet the&nbsp;data subject rights requirements of GDPR. SNTC Rice\n            Sourcing processes or stores all personal data in fully vetted, DPA compliant vendors. We do store all\n            conversation and personal data for up to 6 years unless your account is deleted. In which case, we dispose\n            of all data in accordance with our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, but we will not hold it longer than\n            60 days.</p>\n        <p>We are aware that if you are working with EU customers, you need to be able to provide them with the ability\n            to access, update, retrieve and remove personal data. We got you! We’ve been set up as self service from the\n            start and have always given you access to your data and your customers data.
